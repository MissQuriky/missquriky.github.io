# Hey there, I am Purva!üëã

Welcome to my creative corner of the internet! ‚ú® I'm Purva Barhate, a digital marketing intern by day  and a passionate graphic designer by night   (Yes, I wear many hats! ) I'm currently conquering Business/Commerce at Wisdom High International School - India , and I'm always on the hunt for new ways to grow my digital marketing skills .

But wait, there's more!  ‚û°Ô∏è When I'm not strategizing killer marketing campaigns , you'll probably find me covered in paint Ô∏è, totally lost in a new artistic adventure  (pottery is my current obsession! ), or exploring any creative avenue that sparks my fancy ‚ú®. Creativity is my oxygen, you could say

I'm here to share my creative journey and hopefully inspire YOU to embrace your inner artist    So, grab your metaphorical paintbrush Ô∏è (or keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è, whatever floats your boat!) and join me on this wild ride!
