# Hey there, I am Purva!ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner fo the internet! I'm Purva Barhate, a Digital Marketing Intern with a passion for graphic design. I'm currently studying Business/Commerce, General at Wisdom High International School - India and I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow in the digital marketing field.

When I'm not strategizing marketing campaigns, you'll find me covered in paint, or getting lost in a new artistic pursuit. Whether it's painting, diving into the world of pottery, or exploring new artistic avenues, creativity fuels my soul. I'm passionate about sharing my journey and hope to inspire others to embrace their creativity on this blog. So, grab your metaphorical paintbrush and join me!
